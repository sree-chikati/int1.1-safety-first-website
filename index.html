                <p id = "text">Safety First is a saying that we’ve all grown up hearing 
                    — that it’s better to prioritize our safety in every situation and avoid unnecessary risks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Like the saying, the app Safety First is aimed to help children through the ages of 
                    two through five (and above) to learn the importance of staying safe during the Corona 
                    Virus Pandemic. It will be a fun, story based game with exciting characters, new missions
                    , and valuable lessons on safety. It will not only focus on the pandemic, but will 
                    also stres the importance of everyday safety.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These minute lessons will not take long to teach; yet, they will engrain valuable 
                    safety lessons within children because they experienced its consequences within a game.
