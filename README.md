 ## About this Project
  
Safety First is a saying that we’ve all grown up hearing — that it’s better to prioritize our safety in every situation and avoid unnecessary risks.

Like the saying, the app **Safety First** is aimed to help children through the ages of two through five (and above) to learn the importance of staying safe during the Corona Virus Pandemic. It will be a fun, story based game with exciting characters, new missions , and valuable lessons on safety. It will not only focus on the pandemic, but will also stres the importance of everyday safety.

These minute lessons will not take long to teach; yet, they will engrain valuable safety lessons within children because they experienced its consequences within a game.

 ## Motivation
 
 >Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. ~ Martin Luter King Jr.
 
Taking inspiration from this quote, I chose to focus on a help the group within society who could use more technological advancements to help them during this day and age. 

While most people are aware of what the virus is capable of and ways to protect themselves, one of the most vulnerable groups within the world remains unaware of how dangerous this virus is: children.

I hope to create a story based gaming app for kids between 2-year-olds and 5-year-olds and give them another medium to understand the importance of staying safe during this pandemic and help educate them on basic safety.
